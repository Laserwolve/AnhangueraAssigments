# AnhangueraAssigments

This repository contains assignments, code, and exercises for the "Algorithms and Structured Programming" course at Anhanguera.

## Structure

- `ALGORITMOS E PROGRAMAÇÃO ESTRUTURADA/` — Main folder for course work, organized by units and lessons.
- Other files and folders may include supporting materials, instructions, or examples.

## How to Compile and Run C Programs

1. Install a C compiler, such as MinGW-w64 or Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools.
2. Use Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft C/C++ extension to edit and compile `.c` files.
3. Compile the desired file. Example using GCC:
	```
	gcc -o program.exe program.c
	```
4. Run the program:
	```
	./program.exe
	```

## Notes

- Compiler-generated files (such as `.exe`, `.obj`, `.ilk`, `.pdb`) are ignored by git in the algorithms folder.
- Program messages and text use only letters without accents for compatibility with all terminals.
